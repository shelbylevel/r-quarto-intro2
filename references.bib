  abstract = {The burden of obesity disproportionately influences poor health outcomes in rural communities in the United States. Various social and environmental factors  contribute to inadequate food access and availability in rural areas, influencing  dietary intakes and food insecurity rates. This study aims to identify patterns  related to food insecurity and fruit and vegetable consumption within a  SNAP-eligible and low-income, highly obese rural Appalachian community. A  prospective cohort was implemented to identify gaps in resources addressing  obesity and food insecurity challenges. SAS 9.4 software was used to examine  differences in dietary intakes and shopping practices among SNAP participants.  Among participants (n = 152), most reported an annual household income less than  USD 20,000 (n = 90, 60.4\%), 29.1\% reported food insecurity, and 39.5\% reported  receiving SNAP benefits within the last month. The overall mean FV intake was  3.46 daily servings (95\% CI: 3.06-3.91) among all participants. SNAP  participation was associated with food insecurity (p = 0.007) and those  participating in SNAP were two times more likely to report being food insecure  (OR = 2.707, 95\% CI: 1.317, 5.563), relative to non-participants. These findings  further depict the need for intervention, as the burden of food insecurity  persists. Tailoring health-promoting initiatives to consider rurality and SNAP  participation is vital for sustainable success among these populations.},
